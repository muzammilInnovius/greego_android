You can \r\nalso learn more at Greego Driver Pay.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>When do I get paid?<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Greego starts the weekly payment process on Tuesdays around 5 am. It \r\nmay take a few hours (or even days) before your deposit shows in your \r\naccount. This can happen because:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Different banks may take longer depending on their deposit processes<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Your bank info is outdated or incorrect. Update payment info in the 'Payouts Information' tab of the Driver Dashboard.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If we\u2019re unable to deposit your earnings, we\u2019ll try again next week. If you need your cash sooner, try using Express Pay.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Fare calculations<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Greego passengers pay drivers ride fare through the app, though riders may also tip with cash.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Driver pay calculation begins when the passenger is in your car and you\u2019ve <strong>tapped to pick up<\/strong>&nbsp;in\r\n the app. Driver pay includes time spent waiting, starting one minute \r\nafter you\u2019ve confirmed your arrival (read our step-by-step guide on how \r\nto give Greego rides). Greego ride fare includes:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Base Fare:<\/strong>&nbsp;The amount passengers pay to start the ride<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Cost per mile:<\/strong>&nbsp;The amount you earn per mile in the city where your ride starts<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Cost per minute:<\/strong>&nbsp;The amount you earn per minute in the region where your ride starts<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We determine all costs per mile or per minute depending on which city\r\n and region in which a ride was requested. See your local pricing on \r\nour Cities page (or skip to subregions).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>We\u2019re testing a new feature where passengers see a confirmed, <strong>upfront price<\/strong>&nbsp;for\r\n each ride. Even if your passenger receives their price up front, you'll\r\n still get paid for time and distance, plus Prime Time. If a ride takes \r\nlonger than we quoted the passenger or they added a stop, we\u2019ll make \r\nsure you receive the new, changed amount for any additional time and \r\ndistance.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Additional charges<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the Greego ride fare, passengers pay:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The Service Fee<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Pickup or drop-off Airport fees<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Venue fees<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Applicable tolls and cancellation fees<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Taxes or other applicable fees Greego is required to collect<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Passengers\u2019 Service Fees, airport fees, and other applicable fees or \r\ntaxes aren\u2019t reflected in the Driver Dashboard's 'Driving History' tab.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under certain circumstances, you may receive a cancellation fee when \r\nyour passenger cancels. Cancellation fees aren\u2019t subject to Greego's \r\ncommission at this time \u2014 you keep the entire amount.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Minimum &amp; maximum fares<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes drivers and passengers may have different trip needs, so we\r\n use minimum and maximum fares to ensure fairness for all trips.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Minimum fare:<\/strong>&nbsp;The lowest amount passengers pay, \r\neven for very short rides. Trips ended before you reach the minimum fare\r\n are rounded up to this amount and include the base fare.<\/li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Maximum fare:<\/strong>&nbsp;The most passengers pay, even for \r\nlonger-than-average rides. If a passenger\u2019s request takes you past the \r\nmaximum fare amount, you may want to recommend a different \r\ntransportation method. Heads up: Unusually high ride amounts are subject\r\n to review, which may delay earnings eligible for Express Pay. \r\nExceedingly long rides (for example, two hours without traffic) may come\r\n close to the max fare.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Greego takes a commission out of minimum and maximum fares. All \r\nminimum and maximum fares are based on the city and region you drive in.\r\n See your local pricing on our Cities page (or skip to subregions).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Tips<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>100% of tips from passengers go to drivers. We built tipping into the\r\n Greego app to make it easy for passengers to say thanks, but passengers\r\n may also tip with cash.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Greego\u2019s commission<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To provide a great platform and keep the community growing, \r\nGreego takes a commission from total ride earnings, including Prime Time\r\n rides. This is shown in your earnings as \u201cGreego Fees.\"<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greego takes no commission from tips.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Subregion pricing<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Some cities that Greego operates in use specialized subregion pricing\r\n as a way to balance driver earnings with passengers\u2019 wallets. Subregion\r\n pricing may be specialized for distinct areas in a given city. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>To see subregions:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Head to our Cities page and choose your city<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Look below normal rates and active ride types<\/li>\r\n\t<li>If your city has subregion pricing, you\u2019ll see a link to the subregion\u2019s blog page below the region's normal rates<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Drivers who pick up passengers in a subregion receive the subregion\u2019s\r\n rate in their earnings. Subregion pricing applies to all modes \r\navailable in a region.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Heads up:<\/strong>&nbsp;subregions don\u2019t have distinct incentives.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any incentive (such as Average Hourly Guarantees or Prime Time) \r\noffered to a broader city also applies to rides taken in the subregion. \r\nAn exception is when subregions are also guarantee zones for Average \r\nHourly Guarantees. Power Driver Bonus is calculated based on the number \r\nof completed rides in a region, so rides to, from, or within a subregion\r\n count toward that total.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check out our in-depth driver pay breakdown for more.<\/p>        <\/div>\r\n\r\n<br><p><\/p>","service_animal_policy":"<p>\r\n<\/p><div>\r\n            <h3>Service animal policy<\/h3>\r\n            <h2>Riders with service animals<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to transporting riders with service animals, drivers on\r\n the Greego platform should remember one thing: Always Say Yes. That's \r\nbecause drivers must comply with applicable laws and Greego\u2019s Service \r\nAnimal Policy. The law and Greego's Service Animal Policy state that \r\ndrivers may not deny service or otherwise discriminate against \r\npassengers with service animals. This means that drivers must transport a\r\n rider with a service animal regardless of whether a driver is allergic \r\nor afraid of these animals, or has a religious or cultural objection to \r\nthem.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A service animal is an animal, usually a dog, that is trained to \r\nperform tasks for an individual with a disability, like blindness or \r\ndeafness. Service animals are not required to wear a tag or vest or be \r\nregistered. Riders with service animals do not need to display any kind \r\nof proof that their animal is a service animal. In other words, if a \r\nrider with a dog says it is a service animal, the driver should \r\ntransport the rider.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greego strives to ensure that people who need rides most are able to \r\nget them. Refusing service to riders with service animals may result in \r\nthe immediate removal of the driver from the Greego platform.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a driver has a question or concern about the policy, or would like\r\n to report a rider who they suspect is abusing the policy, they should \r\ncall the Service Animal Hotline after they transport the rider and their\r\n service animal to their desired destination.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><\/a>Drivers with service animals<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is Greego\u2019s policy that drivers are permitted to ride with their \r\nservice animals. However, this may limit the number of passengers you \r\ncan carry, and some passengers may be uncomfortable or allergic around \r\nyour service animal and will ask you to cancel their request. It is \r\nadvised that you call the passenger in advance to notify them of the \r\nservice animal. If they are unable to ride with your service animal, you\r\n must cancel the ride so they can request another driver. Pro- tip: If \r\nthe request came from nearby, sign out of driver mode for a minute so \r\nthat you don't receive the passenger's next request.<\/p>        <\/div>\r\n\r\n<br><p><\/p>"}

         * driver_pay : <p>
         </p><div>
         <h3>How and when driver pay is calculated</h3>
         <p>When driving for Greego, you should always know how your
         pay is calculated and be able to keep track of your earnings. You can
         also learn more at Greego Driver Pay.</p>

         <h2>When do I get paid?</h2>

         <p>Greego starts the weekly payment process on Tuesdays around 5 am. It
         may take a few hours (or even days) before your deposit shows in your
         account. This can happen because:</p>

         <ul>
         <li>Different banks may take longer depending on their deposit processes</li>
         <li>Your bank info is outdated or incorrect. Update payment info in the 'Payouts Information' tab of the Driver Dashboard.</li>
         </ul>

         <p>If we’re unable to deposit your earnings, we’ll try again next week. If you need your cash sooner, try using Express Pay.</p>

         <h2>Fare calculations</h2>

         <p>Greego passengers pay drivers ride fare through the app, though riders may also tip with cash.</p>

         <p>Driver pay calculation begins when the passenger is in your car and you’ve <strong>tapped to pick up</strong>&nbsp;in
         the app. Driver pay includes time spent waiting, starting one minute
         after you’ve confirmed your arrival (read our step-by-step guide on how
         to give Greego rides). Greego ride fare includes:</p>

         <ul>
         <li><strong>Base Fare:</strong>&nbsp;The amount passengers pay to start the ride</li>
         <li><strong>Cost per mile:</strong>&nbsp;The amount you earn per mile in the city where your ride starts</li>
         <li><strong>Cost per minute:</strong>&nbsp;The amount you earn per minute in the region where your ride starts</li>
         </ul>

         <p>We determine all costs per mile or per minute depending on which city
         and region in which a ride was requested. See your local pricing on
         our Cities page (or skip to subregions).</p>

         <p>We’re testing a new feature where passengers see a confirmed, <strong>upfront price</strong>&nbsp;for
         each ride. Even if your passenger receives their price up front, you'll
         still get paid for time and distance, plus Prime Time. If a ride takes
         longer than we quoted the passenger or they added a stop, we’ll make
         sure you receive the new, changed amount for any additional time and
         distance.</p>

         <h2>Additional charges</h2>

         <p>In addition to the Greego ride fare, passengers pay:</p>

         <ul>
         <li>The Service Fee</li>
         <li>Pickup or drop-off Airport fees</li>
         <li>Venue fees</li>
         <li>Applicable tolls and cancellation fees</li>
         <li>Taxes or other applicable fees Greego is required to collect</li>
         </ul>

         <p>Passengers’ Service Fees, airport fees, and other applicable fees or
         taxes aren’t reflected in the Driver Dashboard's 'Driving History' tab.</p>

         <p>Under certain circumstances, you may receive a cancellation fee when
         your passenger cancels. Cancellation fees aren’t subject to Greego's
         commission at this time — you keep the entire amount.</p>

         <h2>Minimum &amp; maximum fares</h2>

         <p>Sometimes drivers and passengers may have different trip needs, so we
         use minimum and maximum fares to ensure fairness for all trips.</p>

         <ul>
         <li><strong>Minimum fare:</strong>&nbsp;The lowest amount passengers pay,
         even for very short rides. Trips ended before you reach the minimum fare
         are rounded up to this amount and include the base fare.</li>
         <li><strong>Maximum fare:</strong>&nbsp;The most passengers pay, even for
         longer-than-average rides. If a passenger’s request takes you past the
         maximum fare amount, you may want to recommend a different
         transportation method. Heads up: Unusually high ride amounts are subject
         to review, which may delay earnings eligible for Express Pay.
         Exceedingly long rides (for example, two hours without traffic) may come
         close to the max fare.</li>
         </ul>

         <p>Greego takes a commission out of minimum and maximum fares. All
         minimum and maximum fares are based on the city and region you drive in.
         See your local pricing on our Cities page (or skip to subregions).</p>

         <h2>Tips</h2>

         <p>100% of tips from passengers go to drivers. We built tipping into the
         Greego app to make it easy for passengers to say thanks, but passengers
         may also tip with cash.</p>

         <h2>Greego’s commission</h2>

         <p>To provide a great platform and keep the community growing,
         Greego takes a commission from total ride earnings, including Prime Time
         rides. This is shown in your earnings as “Greego Fees."</p>

         <p>Greego takes no commission from tips.</p>

         <h2>Subregion pricing</h2>

         <p>Some cities that Greego operates in use specialized subregion pricing
         as a way to balance driver earnings with passengers’ wallets. Subregion
         pricing may be specialized for distinct areas in a given city. </p>

         <p>To see subregions:</p>

         <ol>
         <li>Head to our Cities page and choose your city</li>
         <li>Look below normal rates and active ride types</li>
         <li>If your city has subregion pricing, you’ll see a link to the subregion’s blog page below the region's normal rates</li>
         </ol>

         <p>Drivers who pick up passengers in a subregion receive the subregion’s
         rate in their earnings. Subregion pricing applies to all modes
         available in a region.</p>

         <p><strong>Heads up:</strong>&nbsp;subregions don’t have distinct incentives.</p>

         <p>Any incentive (such as Average Hourly Guarantees or Prime Time)
         offered to a broader city also applies to rides taken in the subregion.
         An exception is when subregions are also guarantee zones for Average
         Hourly Guarantees. Power Driver Bonus is calculated based on the number
         of completed rides in a region, so rides to, from, or within a subregion
         count toward that total.</p>

         * service_animal_policy : <p>
         </p><div>
         <h3>Service animal policy</h3>
         <h2>Riders with service animals</h2>

         <p>When it comes to transporting riders with service animals, drivers on
         the Greego platform should remember one thing: Always Say Yes. That's
         because drivers must comply with applicable laws and Greego’s Service
         Animal Policy. The law and Greego's Service Animal Policy state that
         drivers may not deny service or otherwise discriminate against
         passengers with service animals. This means that drivers must transport a
         rider with a service animal regardless of whether a driver is allergic
         or afraid of these animals, or has a religious or cultural objection to
         them.</p>

         <p>A service animal is an animal, usually a dog, that is trained to
         perform tasks for an individual with a disability, like blindness or
         deafness. Service animals are not required to wear a tag or vest or be
         registered. Riders with service animals do not need to display any kind
         of proof that their animal is a service animal. In other words, if a
         rider with a dog says it is a service animal, the driver should
         transport the rider.</p>

         <p>Greego strives to ensure that people who need rides most are able to
         get them. Refusing service to riders with service animals may result in
         the immediate removal of the driver from the Greego platform.</p>

         <p>If a driver has a question or concern about the policy, or would like
         to report a rider who they suspect is abusing the policy, they should
         call the Service Animal Hotline after they transport the rider and their
         service animal to their desired destination.</p>


         <h2><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow"></a>Drivers with service animals</h2>

         <p>It is Greego’s policy that drivers are permitted to ride with their
         service animals. However, this may limit the number of passengers you
         can carry, and some passengers may be uncomfortable or allergic around
         your service animal and will ask you to cancel their request. It is
         advised that you call the passenger in advance to notify them of the
         service animal. If they are unable to ride with your service animal, you
         must cancel the ride so they can request another driver. Pro- tip: If
         the request came from nearby, sign out of driver mode for a minute so
         that you don't receive the passenger's next request.</p>        </div>
